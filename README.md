# INTERFACING-OF-TEMPERATURE-SENSOR-WITH-ARM-LPC1768-PROCESSOR

# AIM: 
   To write an embedded c program to interface TEMPERATURE SENSOR with ARM processor         
           
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

## HARDWARE:
LPC1768 / LPC1343
LM 35
LCD module
## SOFTWARE:
Coocox IDE Docklight


# PROCEDURE:
Step 1: Go to start All programs  COIDE
Step 2: Give a suitable file name for your project and give the destination folder and then next Step 3: Go to chip NXP LPC 13XX  LPC1343  Next
Step 4: Select the required library file (SYSCON and GPIO) from the repository Step 5: A new project will be created
Step 6: Double click on main.c and type the program
Step 7: Add the required library source file to the project (Right click on include Add file to group and add the source file)
Step 8: Build the program using build option
Step 9: Flash the program by clicking on download code to flash Step 10: Interface the required component and note down the output For Docklight:
Step 1: Go to start Docklight Ok
Step 2: Start with the blank project /blank script continue 4647
Step 3: Enable keyboard console by clicking on it
Step 4: Now flash (run) the program on COIDE, the output will be displayed on the serial window in the Docklight System window
